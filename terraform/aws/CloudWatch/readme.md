Deployment Steps:

-Install Terraform and AWS CLI; configure AWS credentials.
-Run terraform init, terraform apply.
-Set up an AWS Batch queue separately (or reference an existing one).
-Install Python deps: pip install boto3.
-Run the simulation script to populate metrics and test alarms.
-For GitHub: Include a dashboard screenshot in README, use GitHub Actions to deploy Terraform on push. Add a hybrid note: Integrate with on-prem via AWS Direct Connect for low-latency metric forwarding.
-Extend: Add auto-scaling group for EC2 Spot instances triggered by alarms.

Security Checklist:

-Least privilege: Use IAM roles for CloudWatch access; e.g., "CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy" only.
-Encrypt SNS: Enable KMS for topic if alerts contain sensitive job data.
-Multi-factor: Require MFA for IAM users accessing dashboards.
-Log retention: Set CloudWatch Logs to 90 days for compliance audits.
-Media-specific: Monitor for anomalous data exfiltration (e.g., custom metric for asset download rates); integrate with AWS GuardDuty for threat detection on render instances.
