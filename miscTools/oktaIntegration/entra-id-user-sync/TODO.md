# TODOs

- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient Graph API failures.

- [ ] Provide Docker-based execution environment for consistent cross-platform runs.
- [ ] Expand automated testing with Pester to cover end-to-end sync using mocked Graph responses.
- [ ] Document how to sync into common M&E directory services (e.g., OpenLDAP, FreeIPA).
