Deployment Steps:

-Install Terraform and Azure CLI on your local machine.
-Run terraform init, terraform apply to provision resources. Note the output storage account name.
-Set up Azure credentials (e.g., az login).
-Install Python deps: pip install azure-storage-blob azure-identity.
-Run the script with local dir path.
-For GitHub: Commit files, add a README with a Mermaid flowchart (e.g., local -> upload -> Azure), and a demo video/script output. Use GitHub Actions for CI to lint Terraform/Python.
-Test hybrid: Simulate on-prem with a local folder; extend to mount on-prem via Azure File Sync.

Security Checklist:

-Use managed identities (via DefaultAzureCredential) instead of keysâ€”avoids credential leaks in code.
-Enable Azure Defender for Storage to scan for malware in uploaded assets.
-Implement role-based access control (RBAC): Assign "Storage Blob Data Contributor" only to migration service principals.
-Encrypt at rest/transit: Default in Azure, but verify with az storage account show.
-Audit logs: Enable diagnostic settings to Azure Monitor for asset access tracking.
-Media-specific: Tag blobs with metadata (e.g., "project:GameX") for IP classification; use private endpoints to prevent public exposure.
